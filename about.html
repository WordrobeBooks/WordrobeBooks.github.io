        <p>
          Wordrobe app is a culmination of the efforts of a team work of volunteers working diligently for more than 3 years. A brief timeline is given below.
        </p>

        <h4>2020 - Exploration</h4>
        <p>The journey started with identifying the limitations and challenges faced by Malayalam Islamic Publishers in bringing their books to a digital platform. Tools and processes were developed to make conversion and publishing of e-book as convenient as possible.</p>

        <h4>2021 - App Development</h4>
        <p>With the e-book creation flow sorted, the attention turned to publishing platforms. None of the established publishing platforms had the features or business model that would cater to the Malayalam Islamic Publishers. A decision was made to start development of an independent platform for publishing the e-books.</p>

        <h4>2023 - Initial Public Release of Apps</h4>
        <p>
          The Wordrobe app launched in Google Play Store and Apple App store.
        </p>
